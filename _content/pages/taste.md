      lasts approximately 90 minutes and is limited to groups of 8 or fewer. We

      into our winemaking process and a close up look at our organically farmed
      vines near the winery. The tour lands at our tasting salon for a seated
      private tasting surrounded by favorite pieces from Jim & Jacky's art
      collection. Here, you can relax and enjoy tasting a selection of our
      delicious wines.
