  - question: "What wines does Young Inglewood produce? "

      Cabernet Franc, Malbec, Merlot, Petit Verdot, Pinot Noir, Aligoté, Napa
      Valley Chardonnay and Vin Clair Rosé.
  - question: How does Young Inglewood Vineyards' estate Napa Valley location
      influence our wine?
    answer: Situated in St. Helena, Napa Valley, Young Inglewood Vineyards is on a
      historic 16-acre property first planted with grapevines in the 1800s. Our
      estate on the benchland in the western reaches of St Helena has endowed us
      with well drained gravelly loam soils, ideal for growing Cabernet
      Sauvignon and other red grape varieties.  ​
  - question: What is Young Inglewood's approach winemaking?
    answer: "Non-interventionist winemaking is key to translating our estate’s
      signature character into wines of balance and elegance. Indigenous yeasts
      ferment our wine. They are an integral part of what makes our wines
      authentically ours. A short sojourn in stainless steel protects the purity
      of our Rosé, while extended aging in French oak builds complexity in our
      other wines. Our minimalist approach to winemaking protects the pedigree
      of our wines. "
