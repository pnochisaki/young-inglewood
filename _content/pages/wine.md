faqs:
  - question: Does Young Inglewood have a wine membership?
    answer: Yes, our membership is called  <a
      href="https://www.younginglewood.com/membership">Friends of Young
      Inglewood</a>. Our FYI membership is a welcoming group of wine
      enthusiasts. FYI members receive wine twice a year and have the
      opportunity to meet at FYI member exclusive events. These events bring
      likeminded folks together to bond over our delicious wine and excellent
      food. Members love bringing friends to their complimentary tasting to
      share our wines and unforgettable organically farmed estate. Members can
      even transfer one of their complimentary wine tasting to a friend for
      their use.
  - question: How does Young Inglewood Vineyards' location influence our wine?
    answer: Our family-owned, organically and regeneratively farmed Napa Valley
      estate in St. Helena rests on the alluvial fan that spreads from the base
      of the Mayacamas. Gravelly loam soils nurture wines of balance and depth.
      Cover crops, bat and bird boxes, and the introduction of beneficial
      insects protect the health of the vines without compromising the soil.
      This connection between family, land, and craftsmanship is what makes
      Young Inglewood wines so special.
  - question: What is Young Inglewood's approach to winemaking?
    answer: Young Inglewood makes wines of place. We guide each vintage with care,
      crafting elegant, site-driven Cabernet Sauvignon and Bordeaux-style wines
      through thoughtful, minimal-intervention winemaking. This allows us to
      fully express our terroir with a light touch, producing distinctly Napa
      Valley wine with balance, sophistication and depth of flavor. Every step
      honors the integrity of our vineyard and the people who bring it to life.
