  - question: How does Young Inglewood Vineyards' location influence our wine?
    answer: Our family-owned, organically and regeneratively farmed Napa Valley
      estate in St. Helena rests on the alluvial fan that spreads from the base
      of the Mayacamas, where gravelly loam soils nurture wines of balance and
      depth. Cover crops, bat and bird boxes, and the introduction of beneficial
      insects protect the health of the vines without compromising the soil.
      This connection between family, land, and craftsmanship is what makes
      Young Inglewood wines so special. ​
  - question: What is Young Inglewood's approach winemaking?
    answer: Young Inglewood makes wines of place. We guide each vintage with care,
      crafting elegant, site-driven Cabernet Sauvignon and Bordeaux-style wines
      through thoughtful, minimal-intervention winemaking. This allows us to
      fully express our terroir with a light touch, producing distinctly Napa
      Valley wine with balance, sophistication and depth of flavor. Every step
      honors the integrity of our vineyard and the people who bring it to life.
