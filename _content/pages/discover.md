  - question: What defines Young Inglewood wine?
    answer: "We guide each vintage with care, crafting elegant, site-driven Cabernet
      Sauvignon and Bordeaux-style wines through thoughtful,
      minimal-intervention winemaking. Just as in life, the guiding principle in
      our wine is balance. From hand farming and native yeast fermentation to
      gentle aging in the cellar, every step honors the integrity of our
      vineyard and the people who bring it to life. While our wines are
      delicious to drink at the vintage, they also age beautifully, providing
      the perfect addition to your cellar. "
  - question: What principles drive Young Inglewood farming and winemaking?
    answer: At our family-owned, Napa Valley estate in St. Helena, we focus on
      producing sustainable, organic, ethical, and superb quality wine. We enjoy
      a terroir that rests on the alluvial fan that spreads from the base of the
      Mayacamas, where gravelly loam soils help us nurture wines of balance and
      depth. Working with, not against nature, we farm our vines organically and
      regeneratively, by hand and using gentle equipment when needed.
      Non-interventionist winemaking is key to translating our estate’s
      signature character into wines of elegance, balance, and grace.

      practices, we work with, not against nature by farming organically and
      regeneratively. We pick grapes by hand to bring them into the winery at

      In the cellar we use a light touch. Our non-interventionist winemaking practices allow us to translate our estate’s signature character into wines of elegance and grace. Our enduring connection between family, land, and craftsmanship is what makes Young Inglewood one of Napa Valley’s most distinctive boutique producers.
