    answer: "We aim to produce elegance in a bottle. Starting with our sustainable
      farming practices, we work with, not against nature by farming organically
      and regeneratively. We pick grapes by hand to bring them into the winery
      and have a light touch using non-interventionalist winemaking practices.
      This allows us to translate our estateâ€™s signature character into wines of
      elegance and grace. Young Inglewood focuses on aiding, rather than
      fighting, natural processes to grow healthy wines and a collegial
      environment. "
