  - question: What makes Young Inglewood Vineyards unique?
    answer: >-
      We aim to produce elegance in a bottle. Starting with our farming
      practices, we work with, not against nature by farming organically and
      regeneratively. We pick grapes by hand to bring them into the winery at
      the perfect moment for depth of flavor. 


      In the cellar we use a light touch. Our non-interventionalist winemaking practices allow us to translate our estate’s signature character into wines of elegance and grace. 


      Our enduring connection between family, land, and craftsmanship is what makes Young Inglewood one of Napa Valley’s most distinctive boutique producers.
