## FAQs

### YOUR WINE SOUNDS AMAZING, HOW CAN I GET SOME?
Create a login to get access to an allocation and order our wine on our purchase page.

### HOW DO I GUARANTEE AN ALLOCATION?
We recommend you join our Friends of Young Inglewood membership. Our FYI members get first access to all our releases.

### CAN YOU SHIP WINE TO ME?
Yes, we can! Our shipping partner takes 2-3 business days to process an order after it has been placed. If possible, we recommend delivery of wine shipments to a business as there is usually someone to accept the package during business hours.

Our biggest concern is to deliver you your wine in the same condition as when it left our winery. That means sometimes we delay shipping until weather conditions become favorable.

If you would like special arrangements for your shipment contact mark@younginglewood.com.
### YOUR WINERY LOOKS BEAUTIFUL, HOW CAN I VISIT?
We are open 7 days a week from wkm - 3pm.
We are open to visitors by reservation only.
We have detailed directions on how to find us on our Contact page.
### WHAT ARE YOUR COVID-19 PROTOCOLS?
We are all fully vaccinated here at the winery and kindly ask that all visitors be fully vaccinated as well. Your host will be wearing a face mask, and we ask you to do the same while youâ€™re not tasting. Masks can be provided on request. We have hand sanitizer available throughout the winery for our mutual use as needed.
