### YOUR WINE SOUNDS AMAZING, HOW CAN I GET SOME?

We're so glad you think so! Creating an [](/profile/create-account)[account](/profile/create-account) gets you access to an introductory allocation and allows you to order wine on our [purchase page](/collection/all).                

### WHAT IF I WANT A MORE EXTENSIVE ALLOCATION?

We recommend you join our [Friends of Young Inglewood (FYI) membership](/membership). In addition to other perks, our FYI members get first access to all our releases.

### AS A MEMBER OF FYI, CAN I CUSTOMIZE MY SHIPMENTS?

Sure, for each scheduled shipment, you can add or replace wines to suit your taste.

* P﻿ro Tip: To replace a bottle, first add the replacement bottle, then remove the one you are replacing.

### CAN YOU SHIP WINE TO ME?

Yes, we can! Our shipping partner takes 2-3 business days to process an order after it has been placed. If possible, we recommend delivery of wine shipments to a business since usually someone is there to accept the package during business hours.

Our biggest concern is to deliver you your wine in the same condition as when it left our winery. That means sometimes we delay shipping until weather conditions become favorable.

If you would like special arrangements for your shipment contact [kevin@younginglewood.com](mailto:kevin@younginglewood.com)

### YOUR WINERY LOOKS BEAUTIFUL, CAN I VISIT?

Absolutely! We are open to visitors by [reservation only](https://www.exploretock.com/younginglewood) 7 days a week from 10am - 3pm.
We have detailed directions on how to find us on our [contact page](/contact).

### HOW DO I RESET MY PASSWORD?

1. Click this [link](/profile/forgot-password)
2. Enter your email address, then click "SEND RESET EMAIL"
3. You will receive an email from us called "Reset Young Inglewood Password". Click the button in the email to access your account, then type in your new password.
4. That's it!

### WHAT ARE THE DETAILS OF YOUR SHIPPING POLICIES?
At Young Inglewood, shipping is calculated by the weight of the package and the distance to ship. Our shipping prices include packaging materials. We insure our shipments but additional insurance may be available for an extra charge. Most orders are processed at, and shipped from Copper Peak Logistics Napa, CA. 
Young Inglewood Vineyards takes protection of your wine seriously. With an uncompromising focus on quality and excellence, we will take care of your wine to the best of our ability while it is in our possession. Our goal is to ensure that your shipment reaches you in the same condition as when it leaves the winery. During the winter and summer months, weather conditions can result in the spoilage of your order. In case of extreme heat or cold on your shipping route, we reserve the right to hold shipments until better weather conditions prevail. Young Inglewood Vineyards is not responsible for, and will not replace wine that is damaged by, extreme weather conditions during shipment.
Our shippers cannot deliver to a P.O. box. If possible, we recommend you ship to a business, rather than a home address, as there is usually someone there to take delivery of the package during business hours.
Young Inglewood may not be able to ship wine to certain states. Due to constantly changing direct shipping laws and regulations, the list of states that we ship to may change at any time. Our website will not allow you to place an order if we cannot legally ship to you. If you live in a state where the direct shipment of wine to you by us may violate the law, we will contact you to discuss options, such as shipping to an alternative address in a state where the direct shipment of wines to consumers is permitted, or storage of the wines at an acceptable third-party storage facility.
Please note that when your wine order is picked up by the common carrier for delivery, the wine becomes your responsibility.  An adult’s signature is required upon delivery. If an adult (21 years or older with proper identification of age) is not available to receive your wine, up to two more attempts to deliver will be made. If these attempts are unsuccessful, your order will be returned to the distribution center from which it originated. In the event you miss your delivery of wine, it is your responsibility to contact the carrier and make new arrangements. If your wine is returned to us after three delivery attempts, it is your responsibility to make new arrangements for your wine to be shipped and new shipping charges will apply.
We will notify you by email when your wines have been shipped. As noted above, your order may be delayed due to weather conditions. Young Inglewood cannot be held responsible for any shipment delays (or wine damaged as a result of such delays) caused by erroneous shipping information provided during the order process, or caused by the failure of an adult to be present for signature at the time the wines are delivered.


### WHAT IF MY WINE HAS BEEN DAMAGED IN SHIPMENT?
If you receive your wine and it has been damaged during shipping, please email us at orders@younginglewood.com within three days of receiving the shipment. Please include a description of the damages and photos, if possible. 

### UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES CAN I GET A REFUND OR REPLACEMENT?
By law, we cannot accept returns of alcoholic beverages unless the product is corked or flawed. If you believe that you are in receipt of a corked or flawed bottle and would like to exchange it, please send an email to orders@younginglewood.com within two days of opening the bottle. We ask that you return the unfinished portion of the original bottle for testing and replacement or refund. 
Upon receipt and inspection of your returned shipment, we will send you an email to let you know the status of your return. Replacement bottles of the exact vintage and format are subject to availability and may not be possible. Refunds will be applied to the credit card or other original method of payment within one month.

### CAN I CANCEL AN ORDER?
You can cancel an order if it has not shipped yet by emailing us at orders@younginglewood.com


### IF I STILL HAVE QUESTIONS OR NEED SPECIAL ASSISTANCE, HOW DO I GET IN TOUCH?

Please email orders@younginglewood.com with any questions or concerns you may have regarding our shipping and return policies.
