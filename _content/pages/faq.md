### YOUR WINE SOUNDS AMAZING, HOW CAN I GET SOME?

We're so glad you think so! Creating an [](/profile/create-account)[account](/profile/create-account) gets you access to an introductory allocation and allows you to order wine on our [purchase page](/collection/all).                

### WHAT IF I WANT A MORE EXTENSIVE ALLOCATION?

We recommend you join our [Friends of Young Inglewood (FYI) membership](/membership). In addition to other perks, our FYI members get first access to all our releases.

### AS A MEMBER OF FYI, CAN I CUSTOMIZE MY SHIPMENTS?

Sure, for each scheduled shipment, you can add or replace wines to suit your taste.

* P﻿ro Tip: To replace a bottle, first add the replacement bottle, then remove the one you are replacing.

### CAN YOU SHIP WINE TO ME?

Yes, we can! We take exceptional care in preparing and shipping your wines, using expedited shipping methods and closely monitoring conditions along your delivery route. Whenever possible, we aim to deliver all orders within two days of leaving our winery to preserve quality from cellar to doorstep. During periods of extreme heat or cold, shipments may be temporarily held to ensure your wines travel under optimal conditions.

Wine is shipped via common carrier and requires an adult signature (21+) upon delivery. For the smoothest experience, we recommend shipping to a business address when possible, as someone is more likely to be available to receive your package during business hours.

If you would like special arrangements for your shipment contact [orders@younginglewood.com](mailto:orders@younginglewood.com)

### WHAT ARE THE DETAILS OF YOUR SHIPPING POLICIES?

Young Inglewood Vineyards takes great care to protect your wine and aims to ensure it arrives in the same condition in which it leaves the winery. Whenever possible, we work to deliver all wines within two days of leaving our facility. Extreme heat or cold can impact shipments, and in unsafe weather conditions, we reserve the right to hold orders until conditions improve. Young Inglewood Vineyards is not responsible for, and will not replace, wine damaged due to extreme weather during transit.

Our shippers cannot deliver to P.O. boxes. When possible, we recommend shipping to a business address, where an adult 21+ is more likely to be available to accept delivery during business hours.

Due to changing direct-to-consumer shipping laws, Young Inglewood may not be able to ship to certain states. Our website will prevent checkout where shipping is not legally permitted. If shipment to your state is restricted, we will contact you to discuss alternatives, such as shipping to an eligible state or storing your wine with an approved third-party facility.

Once your order is picked up by the carrier, responsibility transfers to you, and an adult signature (21+ with valid ID) is required. If no adult is available, up to two additional delivery attempts will be made before the order is returned to the distribution center. If returned, you will be responsible for reshipment and applicable fees. You will receive an email when your order ships. Young Inglewood is not responsible for delays or damage caused by weather, incorrect shipping information, or the absence of an adult at delivery.

### WHAT IF MY WINE HAS BEEN DAMAGED IN SHIPMENT?

If you receive your wine and it has been damaged during shipping, please email us at [orders@younginglewood.com](mailto:orders@younginglewood.com)
 within three days of receiving the shipment. Please include a description of the damages and photos, if possible. 

### UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES CAN I GET A REFUND OR REPLACEMENT?

By law, we cannot accept returns of alcoholic beverages unless the product is corked or flawed. If you believe that you are in receipt of a corked or flawed bottle and would like to exchange it, please send an email to [orders@younginglewood.com](mailto:orders@younginglewood.com) within two days of opening the bottle. We ask that you return the unfinished portion of the original bottle for testing and replacement or refund. 
Upon receipt and inspection of your returned shipment, we will send you an email to let you know the status of your return. Replacement bottles of the exact vintage and format are subject to availability and may not be possible. Refunds will be applied to the credit card or other original method of payment within one month.

### CAN I CANCEL AN ORDER?

You can cancel an order if it has not shipped yet by emailing us at [orders@younginglewood.com](mailto:orders@younginglewood.com)

### IF I STILL HAVE QUESTIONS OR NEED SPECIAL ASSISTANCE, HOW DO I GET IN TOUCH?

Please email [orders@younginglewood.com](mailto:orders@younginglewood.com) with any questions or concerns you may have regarding our shipping and return policies.
