### YOUR WINE SOUNDS AMAZING, HOW CAN I GET SOME?

Create a login to get access to an allocation and order our wine on our purchase page.

### HOW DO I GUARANTEE AN ALLOCATION?

We recommend you join our Friends of Young Inglewood membership. Our FYI members get first access to all our releases.

### CAN YOU SHIP WINE TO ME?

Yes, we can! Our shipping partner takes 2-3 business days to process an order after it has been placed. If possible, we recommend delivery of wine shipments to a business as there is usually someone to accept the package during business hours.

Our biggest concern is to deliver you your wine in the same condition as when it left our winery. That means sometimes we delay shipping until weather conditions become favorable.

If you would like special arrangements for your shipment contact mark@younginglewood.com.

### YOUR WINERY LOOKS BEAUTIFUL, HOW CAN I VISIT?

We are open 7 days a week from 10am - 3pm.
We are open to visitors by reservation only.
We have detailed directions on how to find us on our Contact page.

### WHAT ARE YOUR COVID-19 PROTOCOLS?

We are all fully vaccinated here at the winery and kindly ask that all visitors be fully vaccinated as well. Currently, we will not be wearing masks during your tastings. However, should you wish to do so, you are welcome to and your host is happy to accommodate and wear a mask as well. Weather permitting, we invite you to taste outside on our beautiful terrace should you prefer.
