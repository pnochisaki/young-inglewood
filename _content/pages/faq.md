### YOUR WINE SOUNDS AMAZING, HOW CAN I GET SOME?

We're so glad you think so! Creating an [](/profile/create-account)[account](/profile/create-account) gets you access to an introductory allocation and allows you to order wine on our [purchase page](/collection/all).                

### WHAT IF I WANT A MORE EXTENSIVE ALLOCATION?

We recommend you join our [Friends of Young Inglewood (FYI) membership](/membership). In addition to other perks, our FYI members get first access to all our releases.

### AS A MEMBER OF FYI, CAN I CUSTOMIZE MY SHIPMENTS?

Sure, for each scheduled shipment, you can add or replace wines to suit your taste.

* Pï»¿ro Tip: To replace a bottle, first add the replacement bottle, then remove the one you are replacing.

### CAN YOU SHIP WINE TO ME?

Yes, we can! Our shipping partner takes 2-3 business days to process an order after it has been placed. If possible, we recommend delivery of wine shipments to a business since usually someone is there to accept the package during business hours.

Our biggest concern is to deliver you your wine in the same condition as when it left our winery. That means sometimes we delay shipping until weather conditions become favorable.

If you would like special arrangements for your shipment contact kevin[@younginglewood.com](mailto:mark@younginglewood.com).

### YOUR WINERY LOOKS BEAUTIFUL, CAN I VISIT?

Absolutely! We are open to visitors by [reservation only](https://www.exploretock.com/younginglewood) 7 days a week from 10am - 3pm.
We have detailed directions on how to find us on our [contact page](/contact).

### HOW DO I RESET MY PASSWORD?

It's very easy - just follow these simple steps:

1. Click this [link](/profile/forgot-password)
2. Enter your email address, then click "SEND RESET EMAIL"
3. You will receive an email from us called "Reset Young Inglewood Password". Click the button in the email to access your account, then type in your new password.
4. That's it!
