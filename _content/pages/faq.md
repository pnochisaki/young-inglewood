### YOUR WINE SOUNDS AMAZING, HOW CAN I GET SOME?

We're so glad you think so! Creating an [](https://younginglewood.com/profile/create-account)[account](https://younginglewood.com/profile/create-account) gets you access to an introductory allocation and allows you to order our wine on our [purchase page](https://younginglewood.com/collection/all).                

### HOW DO I GET A MORE EXTENSIVE ALLOCATION?

We recommend you join our [Friends of Young Inglewood membership](https://younginglewood.com/membership). In addition to other perks, our FYI members get first access to all our releases.

### CAN YOU SHIP WINE TO ME?

Yes, we can! Our shipping partner takes 2-3 business days to process an order after it has been placed. If possible, we recommend delivery of wine shipments to a business since usually someone is there to accept the package during business hours.

Our biggest concern is to deliver you your wine in the same condition as when it left our winery. That means sometimes we delay shipping until weather conditions become favorable.

If you would like special arrangements for your shipment contact [mark@younginglewood.com](mailto:mark@younginglewood.com).
