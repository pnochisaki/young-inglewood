    answer: >-
      Fans of Young Inglewood wines love the versatility of our wines. We have
      cracked the code on complexity and depth of flavor while maintaining our
      wines’ approachability and flexibility with food. Fans are just as likely
      to open our bottles to enjoy alongside a delicious meal as they are to
      savor our bottle over a delightful fireside chat. 


      Wine cellar enthusiasts love the ageability of our wines. We hear from fans who open an

      older vintage of ours that they love the smoothness and finish of those wines. Our estate tasting experience brings fans back again and again. They love the beauty of our property and comment on how aptly it reflects our elegant and delicious wine.
  - answer: We ship wine to you twice a year. The month before your shipment, on the
      Club Shipments tab, you will see what wines our winemakers have included
      for you in the current shipment for your wine membership. We will also
      include a couple of optional winemaker selections for you to add to or
      substitute in your shipment. You have the flexibility to decide and
      customize your wine selections for each shipment.
