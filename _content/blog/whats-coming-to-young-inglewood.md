Scott will be in Houston for [Southern Smoke Decanted](https://southernsmoke.org/southern-smoke-decanted-2026/), a high-seas–inspired vintner tasting reception and auction where indulgence meets impact. Set sail on a night of exceptional wines, elevated bites, and effortless luxury, all underscored by the smooth sounds of Yacht Rock and classic Hip Hop. Sip your way through an expertly curated tasting reception presented by Lexus, then take your seat for a high-energy live auction—paddle up for a cause that fuels the heart of the food and beverage community, benefiting Southern Smoke Foundation.

We’re excited to take part in additional regional events throughout the year and hope to see you at one of them.

If you’re unable to join us at any of these, Shannon would be happy to host you and your friends or family for a private tasting experience. Simply call [707.200.4572](tel:707.200.4572) or email [shannon@younginglewood.com](mailto:shannnon@younginglewood.com) to plan your visit to the estate.
