A key vineyard task – perhaps the key vineyard task we do early in the year – is to prune the vines. We typically prune our vines between end of January and early March. 

### What does pruning do?

The buds to produce the year’s crop were set during the previous growing season. During pruning, for each individual vine, we decide how many of those buds we want to allow to grow. The buds produce shoots, which will eventually bear the grape clusters. During pruning, we can force the vine to focus its energies on growing the number of shoots we think is appropriate so that the fruit each vine produces is concentrated and top quality.

At pruning, we can also decide in which direction we want the shoots to grow, which determines the distribution of shoots, and eventually leaves and fruit, throughout the vine. This helps us ensure that each shoot will get the right amount of sunlight and shade to allow it to ripen its fruit evenly.

### What happens next?

When the tender buds have broken through, we are on the alert for cooler nighttime temperatures that might foretell a freak frost that will nip the buds, and any fruit they might produce. In the balmy daytime temperatures frost seems hard to imagine, but anyone who farms will tell you it can happen and will sometimes. It’s time for spring and the leaves and grapes to develop. We love watching this process and look forward to sharing more about this next time.
