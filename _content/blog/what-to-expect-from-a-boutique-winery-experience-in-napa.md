A visit to Napa Valley often brings visions of crowded tasting rooms. For those who prefer something more private and educational—a boutique winery experience offers an entirely different kind of magic and draw. 

Here at Young Inglewood Vineyards, our tasting experience is intimate and elevated. Guests aren’t just poured wines; they’re welcomed into our story—one shaped by family, guided by craft, and surrounded by nature. From thoughtful hospitality to immersive vineyard views, every moment is curated for connection. 

### What is a Boutique Winery? The Heart of Napa's Wine Culture

Boutique wineries are small-scale production wineries that produce less than 10,000 cases annually. Here at Young Inglewood, we take boutique to the next level, producing only 1200 cases annually. Our small scale production allows us to focus on quality and the consumer. Hospitality is tailored to each visitor’s unique desires.

Boutique wineries like us are deeply tied to our land and our community. Our small team touches each part of the wine making process, crafting a unique, limited-production wine. For us, winemaking starts in the vineyard. Expertly cared for grapes produces delectable wines. We harvest and sort our grapes by hand ensuring excellent quality fermentation. 

We identify as a family-run winery. Led by a mother-son winemaking team, the estate embraces balance in all things—from vine to cellar . We invite you to share and experience our beautiful and peaceful property as you drink our elegant, delicious wine.

### Creating Lasting Memories

A great pleasure in visiting a boutique winery estate is the opportunity for a private wine tasting—a format where guests engage directly with knowledgeable hosts in a relaxed, conversational setting. They’re designed to meet you where you are, whether you’re a seasoned collector or exploring wine for the first time.

At Young Inglewood, each tasting begins with a toast of our [Vin Clair Rose](https://www.younginglewood.com/collection/all). We progress through nuanced reds like the [Right Bank Blend](https://www.younginglewood.com/collection/all) or [Estate Cabernet Franc](https://www.younginglewood.com/collection/all). With each pour, the team offers insight into varietal character, vintage expression, and cellar decisions that shape the final wine.

It’s this sense of welcome that transforms a wine tasting into a memory—where the wine lingers long after the glass is empty.

### Experience the Beauty of St. Helena

Saint Helena sits at the heart of Napa Valley, known for its scenic beauty and quiet sophistication. At Young Inglewood, the setting is both refined and grounded—an estate that unfolds gently from the road, surrounded by olive trees, heritage vines, and soft golden light.

There is a distinct romantic ambiance at play here. It’s in the way the vines move in the breeze, how the light shifts throughout the afternoon, and the quiet hum of the countryside. For couples, anniversaries, or anyone craving stillness, Young Inglewood offers a tranquil and atmospheric setting in Napa Valley. 

### The Charm of an Intimate Wine Tasting at Young Inglewood

The personal wine tasting format isn’t just about preference—it’s about presence. You’ll be greeted by name, guided with care, and invited to engage in real conversation about the wines and the people behind them.

It’s in these quiet exchanges—between sips and stories—that guests often realize they’ve discovered something special: a winery that treats them like family.

### Tour the Winery: A Glimpse into our Winemaking

For those who want to go deeper, touring the winery reveals the creative and technical side of winemaking. 

These behind-the-scenes experiences elevate a guided wine tasting into something immersive. The sights, smells, and tactile sensations of the winery bring the wine to life in a new way. We highlight not just how things are done, but also our thought process behind each step.

### Understanding Napa's Terroir Through Delicious Handcrafted Wine

The best wine experiences go beyond tasting notes to delve into how to taste and enjoy wine. At Young Inglewood, visitors learn about wine in a setting that’s both insightful and approachable.

The team shares how our terroir—its soils, slopes, and microclimates— in Napa Valley shapes each vintage. Guests explore topics like vineyard spacing, clonal selection, and the influence of natural fermentation. 

We believe winery education creates a deeper appreciation—not just for a single bottle, but for the philosophy behind every wine. It goes beyond our winery and our intentions behind each bottle. With your new found expertise, you can appreciate other wine bottles in new ways.
