A visit to Napa Valley often brings visions of crowded tasting rooms. For those who prefer something more private and enlightening—a boutique winery experience offers an entirely different kind of magic and draw. 

Here at Young Inglewood Vineyards, our tasting experience is intimate and elevated. Guests aren’t just poured wines; they’re welcomed into our story—one shaped by family, guided by craft, and surrounded by nature. From thoughtful hospitality to immersive vineyard views, every moment is curated for connection. 

### What is a Boutique Winery? The Heart of Napa's Wine Culture

Boutique wineries are small-scale production wineries that produce less than 10,000 cases annually. Here at Young Inglewood, we take boutique to the next level, producing only 1200 cases annually. Our small scale production allows us to focus on quality and the consumer. Hospitality is tailored to each visitor’s unique desires.

Boutique wineries like us are deeply tied to our land and our community. Our small team touches each part of the wine making process, crafting a unique, limited-production wine. For us, winemaking starts in the vineyard. Expertly cared for grapes produces delectable wines. We harvest and sort our grapes by hand ensuring excellent quality fermentation. 

We identify as a family-run winery. Led by a mother-son winemaking team, the estate embraces balance in all things—from vine to cellar . We invite you to share and experience our beautiful and peaceful property as you drink our elegant, delicious wine.

### Custom Wine Tasting Moments for Creating Lasting Memories

One of the greatest pleasures of visiting a boutique estate is the opportunity for a custom wine tasting—a format where guests engage directly with knowledgeable hosts in a relaxed, conversational setting. These tastings are not rushed or standardized. They’re designed to meet you where you are, whether you’re a seasoned collector or exploring wine for the first time.

At Young Inglewood, each tasting unfolds at a graceful pace. You may begin with a glass of the Estate Sauvignon Blanc and progress through nuanced reds like the Right Bank Blend or Estate Cabernet Franc. With each pour, the team offers insight into varietal character, vintage expression, and cellar decisions that shape the final wine.

It’s this sense of welcome that transforms a wine tasting into a memory—where the wine lingers long after the glass is empty.

### Vineyard Views and Experiences: The Beauty of St. Helena

Saint Helena sits at the heart of Napa Valley, known for its scenic beauty and quiet sophistication. At Young Inglewood, the setting is both refined and grounded—an estate that unfolds gently from the road, surrounded by olive trees, heritage vines, and soft golden light.

The views aren’t just picturesque; they’re immersive. Visitors are encouraged to take in the surroundings, wander between rows, or sit beneath shaded trees. It’s a chance to feel the rhythm of the vineyard and understand how place influences the wine in your glass.

### The Romantic Ambiance of Vineyard Landscapes in St. Helena

There is a distinct romantic ambiance at play here. It’s in the way the vines move in the breeze, how the light shifts throughout the afternoon, and the quiet hum of the countryside. For couples, anniversaries, or anyone craving stillness, Young Inglewood offers one of the most tranquil and atmospheric settings in Napa Valley.

This setting is not staged or overly manicured. It feels lived-in and loved—like a place that continues to grow, season by season, into something enduring.

### The Intimate Charm of a Personal Wine Tasting at Young Inglewood

Hospitality at Young Inglewood is deliberately personal. The personal wine tasting format isn’t just about preference—it’s about presence. You’ll be greeted by name, guided with care, and invited to engage in real conversation about the wines and the people behind them.

It’s in these quiet exchanges—between sips, between stories—that guests often realize they’ve discovered something rare: a winery that sees them, not just as visitors, but as guests.

### Tour the Winery: A Glimpse into Winemaking Artistry

For those who want to go deeper, touring the winery reveals the creative and technical side of winemaking. Guests can witness the gravity-flow production process, learn about small-lot fermentation, and see how aging choices are made barrel by barrel.

These behind-the-scenes experiences elevate a guided wine tasting into something immersive. The sights, smells, and tactile sensations of the winery bring the wine to life in a new way—one that’s hard to replicate in larger venues.

You’ll see not just how wine is made, but why it’s made this way.

### Wine Education Beyond the Glass: Understanding Napa's Terroir

Wine isn’t just a beverage—it’s a story of place, time, and craft. That’s why the best wine experiences go beyond tasting notes and dive into education. At Young Inglewood, visitors have the opportunity to learn about wine in a setting that’s both insightful and approachable.

The team shares how Napa’s terroir—its soils, slopes, and microclimates—shapes each vintage. Guests explore topics like vineyard spacing, clonal selection, and the influence of natural fermentation. These details add richness to each tasting and help frame what makes Young Inglewood’s wines so distinctive.
This kind of winery education creates a deeper appreciation—not just for a single bottle, but for the philosophy behind every wine crafted here.
