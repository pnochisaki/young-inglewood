title: Celebrating Earth Month

At Young Inglewood Vineyards, we consider every day Earth Day. We're sharing some of the ways we're working to keep our farming, winemaking and operations as sustainable and Mother Nature friendly as possible.

Starting with our sustainable farming practices, we work with, not against nature by farming organically and regeneratively.

* Bat and bird boxes in the vineyards provide natural pest control and encourage the cycle of life.
* Open-air burning pollutes the atmosphere. Instead, we chose to use a contained box in which to burn our recycled vines. The process not only reduces emissions but also creates biochar which sequesters carbon and provides compost.
* Sparse, strategic irrigations foster deep vine roots and resilient vines.
* Each vine is considered individually during pruning so each vine only produces the amount of grapes that vine can reasonably fully nurture.
* Our farming has been completely organic since 2008, meaning zero harmful chemicals and as much hand work as possible. As of 2023 we are organic certified.

 These practices help us grow strong resilient vines which produce beautiful, healthy grapes. We believe sustainable farming practices ensure that we preserve our environment for the future.

At every step in our winemaking process, we consider the impact on our land and estate. As with our farming practices outside the winery, we prioritize sustainability inside the winery as well.

* During winery construction, we chose to locate our barrel cellar underground to reduce the need for cooling.
* Grape pomace from winemaking at harvest is used as compost in the vineyards later in the year.
* Everyday operations at Young Inglewood are made more sustainable with the help of solar panels on our winery roof.
* Our use of lightweight wine bottles reduces packaging and carbon emissions when we ship our wine.

Let's celebrate the earth together every day. 

Looking forward to raising a glass with you soon!
